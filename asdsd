Build âš™ and Deploy ðŸš€ 

This repository contains the Zigbee2MQTT documentation.

It is based on VuePress v2.

Architecture
Directory-Structure:

docgen: Some scripts to test and generate the Device-Pages.
docs: The actual documentation.
docs/.vuepress: Some VuePress enhancements like Stylesheets.
public: Static assets.
supported-devices-component: Vue.js component rendering the devices-overview page.
navbar.ts: Configuration for the top navigation.
sidebar.ts: Configuration for the sidebars by individual sections (like Guide).
vuepress.config.ts: The VuePress config file.
Docgen
The docgen-scripts helps to generate and update the individual device-pages (/docs/devices/*.md). zigbee-herdsman-converters exposes a list with supported devices which is used for generation. It also updates the Devices-List used by the Supported-Devices overview page.

The ## Notes section of each page is writte by hand and does not come from zigbee-herdsman-converters. This section gets preserved and can be edited.

Docgen is written in Typescript, so you need a recent version of Node.js and NPM.
